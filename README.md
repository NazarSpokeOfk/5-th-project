**Hello there**

**Technologies**<br/>

* React JS <br/>
* SCSS(SASS)<br/>
* Marvel API<br/>

**You should know**<br/>

All received data comes from the Server, this means that the code is asynchronous.
The API that is used in this web application is https://developer.marvel.com/account.
In the MarvelService component, in the MarvelService file, on line 4, a unique developer API key is used.
You may need to register your developer profile and replace this API key with yours.

**You Can**<br/>

* Study character information<br/>
* Get more characters<br/>
* look at their images<br/>
* Get a list of comics in which they participated<br/>

**Description**<br/>
This web application is built using the React Js library , with hooks.
This web application contains information about Marvel superheroes.

**Instructions**<br/>

1. Make sure that you have the React library installed on your PC. Here is the full instruction - <br/> https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/ <br/>
2.make sure that you have the project hierarchy built correctly. <br/>
3.you will need to create react-application, then go to the project directory in the terminal. See the instructions for creating in the first point. <br/>
4.Then, run the web application, and start using it.<br/>
5.You should use **npm i sass** in your project

**Optional Instructions**<br/>

**if your project does not work, follow these instructions:**<br/>

1. You can create an empty folder, and then create a React App in it, and then just swap the src folders, and also add the style folders, and other folders. If you will use this method, you should also change the imports in the files.<br/>

2.You can create an empty React App , and recopy the text manually. I know this method is not as efficient, but if you do everything according to the hierarchy within the repository, the project will work.<br/>

3.You can watch the video from my past repository as it is suitable for this improved project as well. I am still working on this project, including this README file, so a tutorial video will be added soon<br/>
